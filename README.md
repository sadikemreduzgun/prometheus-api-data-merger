# Get Node Exporter and Libvirt Exporter metrics using Prometheus API

## A Quick Explanation:
#### In data folder there is all_queries csv file. It contains node exporter and libvirt exporter queries.
#### In src file there are codes. In python file, organzier.py there are functions to organize urls, instances, queries.

‚öôÔ∏è In organize.py file there are 3 organizer function: curly_organizer function deletes statements in selector: "{ }",and time selector: "[ ]". curly_organizer puts selected instance, time selector, device name.

‚öôÔ∏è organize_url function is used to some problems at query and prevent the mess of characters like " + ", " " ", " * ". Because generally operations like addition on query can't be done. 

‚öôÔ∏è organize_instance function is used to give instance and device name to organize_url function.

‚öôÔ∏è reach_selection_data.py file is used to return instance and device name by getting default date and time from reach_time.py file's give_default_dates function. That fundtion recursively finds a common date and time of the virtual machine(s) and server. Default time interval between start and end time is 1 day and 5 minutes it is changeable.

‚öôÔ∏è main.py uses mentioned-above functions. It creates dataframes by performing some operations(explained in code) and saves them.
